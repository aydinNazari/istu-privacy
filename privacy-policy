Privacy Policy (ISTU)

Last updated: September 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what personal data ISTU (“we”, “us”) collects through the ISTU mobile application (“App”), how we use it, and the choices you have. By using the App, you agree to this Policy.

1. Who we are & contact

Data Controller: ISTU
Email: abdullah.sadat@istu.edu.pl

2. What we collect

Depending on how you use the App, we may process:

Account & Profile: name, email address, profile photo (if you add one).

Authentication: Google Sign-In identifiers (token/ID), if you choose that login method.

Usage & Diagnostics: app interactions, crash logs, device model/OS, IP (approx. region), push token (for notifications).

Location (optional): if you grant permission for location-based features.

Content you provide: files/photos/PDFs or other content you upload within the App.

3. Why we use your data (purposes & legal bases)

We process data to:

Provide and operate the App (create/login to your account, core features) – performance of a contract.

Improve and secure the App (analytics, debugging, fraud prevention) – legitimate interests.

Send optional notifications (announcements, updates) – consent (you can disable any time in device settings).

Comply with legal obligations (security, record-keeping).

4. Third-party service providers

We use trusted vendors as processors to deliver the App:

Google/Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Firestore/Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics, Cloud Messaging for push).
These providers process data on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect it and not use it for their own purposes.

5. Data retention

We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above.

Account/profile data: while your account is active.

Diagnostics/analytics: typically up to 24 months (shorter where feasible).
We may keep minimal logs to meet legal requirements or resolve disputes.

6. International transfers

Some providers (e.g., Google) may process data outside your country (including outside the EEA). We rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) and technical measures to protect your data.

7. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. No system is 100% secure, but we work to continuously improve our safeguards.

8. Your choices & rights

Access, rectify, erase, restrict, object, and data portability (GDPR).

Withdraw consent at any time (e.g., disable notifications/location in device settings).

Delete your account/data: You can request deletion by emailing abdullah.sadat@istu.edu.pl
 from your registered email. We will confirm and erase personal data unless we must retain certain records by law.
If you are in the EEA/UK, you may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

9. Children’s privacy

The App is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age required by local law (e.g., 13–16 in the EEA). If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us to remove it.

10. Cookies & tracking

The mobile App does not use website cookies. If you visit our website, cookies may be used there—see the website cookie notice. The App may use device identifiers and analytics strictly to provide, secure, and improve the service (see sections above).

11. Changes

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version in the App and/or on our website with a new “Last updated” date. Material changes will be highlighted where appropriate.
